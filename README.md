I want to take up 100 days challenge for upskill my knowledge

# java notes:

======================

## 1.1 Why you must learn Java

1. One of the most popular language. Java
   currently runs on 60,00,00,00,000
   devices.
2. Wide Usage (Web-apps, backend,
   Mobile apps, enterprise software).
3. High paying and a lot of Jobs
4. Object Oriented
5. Rich APIs and Community Support

## 1.2 What is a Programming Language :

Compiler converts high level languages to low level languages or machine code.

1.Humans use natural language (like Hindi/English) to communicate
2.Computers only understand 0/1 or on/off
3.Giving instructions to a computer
: - Instructions: Tells computer what to do , These instructions are called code. Human instructions are given in High level languages.

## 1.3 What is an Algorithm

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.

## 1.4 What is Syntax

Structure of words in a sentence.
• Rules of the language.
• For programming exact syntax must be followed.

## 1.5 History of Java

Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (Early 1990s):
Originally named 'Oak', later renamed Java in 1995

1.First Release (1995): Introduced "Write Once, Run Anywhere" concept with cross-platform compatibility.
2.Developed with vision of backward compatibility. Should not break with new version release.
3.Rapid Growth and Diversification (Late 1990s - 2010s): Expanded from web applets to server-side applications; standardized into different editions for various computing platforms.
4.first version of java is JDK Beta
5.As of February 2024, the latest Java
JDK version is JDK 21. It was released on September 19, 2023, and is a long-term support (LTS) release. This means that it will be supported with updates and security fixes for at least eight years.

## 1.6 Magic of Byte Code

intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program). This intermediate code makes Java a platform-independent language.

## 1.7 How Java Changed the Internet

1.Portability with Write Once Run Anywhere
2.Security because of Code running on Virtual Machine

## 1.8 Java Buzzwords or features.

1.Robust
:- Java is robust due to its strong memory management, exception handling, and typechecking mechanisms, which help in preventing system crashes and ensuring reliable performance.
2.Multithreaded
:- Multithreading in programming is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently,
allowing for more efficient processing and task management.
3.Architecture Neutral
:- Java is architecturally neutral because its compiled code (bytecode) can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying hardware architecture.
4.Interpreted and High Performance
:-Java combines high performance with interpretability, as its bytecode is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which employs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for efficient and fast execution.
5.Distributed
:-Java is inherently distributed, designed to facilitate networkbased application development and interaction, seamlessly integrating with Internet protocols and remote method invocation.

## 1.9 Object Oriented Programming

: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

## 2. Java Basics

## 2.1 Installing JDK

steps:
1.Search JDK Download
2.Make sure to download from the oracle website.
3.Download the latest version

## 2.5 File Extensions

.Java
• Contains Java Source Code
• High Level Human Readable
• Used for Development
• File is editable

.Class
• Contains Java Bytecode
• For consumption of JVM
• Used for Execution
• Not meant to be edited

## 2.6 JDK vs JVM vs JRE

1. .JDK
   It's a software development kit required to develop Java applications.
   • Includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), a doc generator
   (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.
   • Essentially, JDK is a superset of JRE

2. .JRE
   It's a part of the JDK but can be downloaded separately.
   • Provides the libraries, the JVM, and other components to run applications
   • Does not have tools and utilities for developers like compilers or debuggers.

3. .JVM
   It's a part of JRE and responsible for executing the bytecode.
   • Ensures Java’s write-once-run-anywhere capability.
   • Not platform-independent: a different JVM is needed for each type of OS.

## 2.8 Importance of the main method

public static void main(String[] args)

• Entry Point: It's the entry point of a Java program, where the execution starts.
Without the main method, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) does not know where to
begin running the code.
• Public and Static: The main method must be public and static, ensuring it's accessible
to the JVM without needing to instantiate the class.
• Fixed Signature: The main method has a fixed signature: public static void
main(String[] args). Deviating from this signature means the JVM won't recognize it
as the starting point.
